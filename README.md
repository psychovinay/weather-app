Weather App
This project, found in the psychovinay/weather-app repository, is a simple, fast, and modern Weather App built primarily with React.js. 
Its core functionality is to fetch and display real-time weather conditions and forecasts for any city around the world, making it a quick and responsive tool for checking weather information.
Key features include real-time data fetching, a simple search functionality by city name, and the display of detailed information like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, all wrapped in a responsive design 
that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The application is predominantly written in JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and component creation, with CSS handling the styling and structure provided by basic HTML.
To get the application running locally, you must first clone the repository, navigate into the mini-project-react folder, and run npm install (or yarn install) to set up the dependencies. 
Crucially, you will need to obtain an API key from a third-party weather service (such as OpenWeatherMap) and store it in a 
.env file within the project directory before executing the app using npm start.
